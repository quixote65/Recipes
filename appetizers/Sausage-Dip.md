Sausage Dip
 
List of ingredients to make one “batch” (we used 5 batches on the camping trip)
 
- 1 lb sausage (I use Jimmy Dean “hot”)
- 1-8 oz pack cream cheese (set out to soften)
- 1- can diced tomatoes & green chilies  (I use “Rotel” mild or hot & spicy)
 
1. Cook sausage, break up into small pieces, “scrambled” then drain off grease.
1. Place sausage back into pot, low temp and add cream cheese, little chunks until melted.
1. Drain liquid from tomatoes & chilies, toss into sausage and cheese, stir to mix and warm 5 more minutes, then EAT! J
 
Dip is great on chips, hot biscuits, by itself or anything you want to put it on!
Double or triple, etc. each ingredient to make a bigger batch
