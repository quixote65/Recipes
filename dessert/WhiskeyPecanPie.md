Prep Time: 10 minutes | Cook Time: 45 minutes 

## INGREDIENTS
```
    1 sheet refrigerated pie crust
    3 eggs
    1/2 cup sugar
    1 stick butter (Melted and cooled)
    1 cup light corn syrup
    1 tsp vanilla
    1 cup pecans, chopped
    1 tsp lemon juice
    1 dash salt
    3 tbs cinnamon whiskey (We like Tennessee Fire)
```

## INSTRUCTIONS
```
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl.

Combine all ingredients, from sugar to cinnamon whiskey. Mix well.

Pour into unbaked pie shell.

Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour. 

Check your crust at 45 minutes and if too brown, cover with foil until the pie is fully baked in the center. 

A knife inserted should come out clean.

Serve with your favorite whipped topping or vanilla ice cream. In true Texas form, use Blue Bell!

## NOTES
```
Alternatively, you can use 1/2 cup light corn syrup and 1/2 cup dark corn syrup 
to achieve the rich mahogany color of classic pecan pies.
